# Breaking Bad

Simple web app using react hooks.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
